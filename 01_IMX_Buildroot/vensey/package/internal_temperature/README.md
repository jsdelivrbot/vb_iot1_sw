It should be noted that this code was found on the Internet from developer blogs. We could not find 
the righ blog later, however, we ported it to the platform as an example application. Though, the 
verification of this software is not done by VeNSeY Tech. 

In order to use this software, the LRADC driver shall be disabled and the related register allocation 
shall be revised on the DTS file.
